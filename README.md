# Perl-Within-Pages

The file you want is pwp.pm. Everything else is just to test it.

This is just my little pragma to embed Perl into webpages and be able to throw things together very quickly.

I like some of the concepts of PHP to be able to include all the different elements into one file and that
file is called by the user and run to use all the part in the programs. Unlike in normal perl where you mush
develop templetes completly seperate form the program file.

I'm sure ther are other ways around this, but this is how I do it, anyway.

Here is a PHP to Perl Within Pages conversion tool:

PHP -> PWP

Open with: <pwp

Close With: pwp>

Include: pwp_include("./file.pwp");
